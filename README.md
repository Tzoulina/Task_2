# Task_2: Understanding State

1. Create a new ReactJS component called Counter that has a count state initialized to 0 
and displays a button to increment the count.
2. Implement a click event handler for the button that updates the count state by 1.
3. In the App component, render the Counter component and observe how the count state 
changes when the button is clicked.
4. Implement a button to decrement the count state by 1.
5. Implement a button to reset the count state to 0.
